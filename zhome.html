            <h2>ZCOINs Token (ZCO) is an ERC-20 token designed for the chess community 
                    and other gaming platforms. ZCOINs Token (ZCO) combines frictionless 
                 yield and deflationary mechanisms to reward holders. Hold and Earn.
            </h2>  
                <p class="par1">ZCO works by applying 2% transaction fee on sells and buys respectively, where 1% on every transaction is burnt forever and 
                        the remaining 1% is distributed among holders. This means that over time, ZCO holders will
                        gain a larger percentage of the total market cap. The initial total supply of ZCO was 1,000,000,000 and is decreasing daily due to burns.
